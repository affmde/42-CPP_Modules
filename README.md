## **_Description_**
This project is composed from 10 different modules. Each module is made to teach some concept  from the CPP language.
<br><br>

## **_Goals_**
The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to
become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!
<br><br>

## **_Contents_** ##

| Module       | Subject   |
| -------------  |:-------------:
| 00             | Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuf|
| 01      |Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement|
| 02  |Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form|
| 03  |Inheritance|
| 04  |Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces|
| 05  |Repetition and Exceptions|
| 06  |C++ casts|
| 07  |C++ templates|
| 08  |Templated containers, iterators, algorithms|
| 09  |STL|
<br><br>

## **_Requirements_**
As this program is coded in Cpp, you will need a compiler as gcc.
<br><br>

## **_How to run it_**
First clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/affmde/42-CPP_Modules.git

```

Then, move to the project folder:

```
$ cd 42-CPP_Modules
```
then choose the module and the exercise(module 01 - ex00 in this example):

```
$ cd module-01/ex00 && make
```
lastly just run the binary
```
$ ./zombie
```
